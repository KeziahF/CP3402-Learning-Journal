# CP3402-Learning-Journal-Week_3

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I used some blogs and WordPress documentation to learn more about the basics of WordPress, however, the majority of my learning this week came from working with WordPress and experimenting with designing different pages.

## Estimated Hours
This week I spent approximately 4 hours on this subject.

## Content Insights
I learned that plugins can be downloaded and added into a WordPress website in order to include additional features such as return to top buttons without needing to insert more complicated code. I also learned how to use the square and curved brackets to turn standard links into hyperlinks in md files. This allowed me to improve the formatting of these documents and allow the key learning resources to be referred back to more easily. Finally, I learned more about [lead nurturing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/8-types-ctas-website-list) as a way to encourage user engagement with my website. This includes encouraging users to sign up across different pages on the website, even if this is just signing up for a mailing list rather than relying on them being willing to sign up for the paying service. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
During the team interviews I found that the questions you asked needed to be very open ended, if someone had any option to respond with one or two words they would take it. This prompted me in later interviews to try to expand questions to encourage more discussion, join questions together or just broaden the question. For example, initially I asked how many days a week are you on campus to try and learn more about potential meeting times and the number of days everyone had to dedicate to university. However, across the interviews I ended up asking more about what commitments people have outside of university and how often they would be available to meet. This also prompted me to consider what types of responses made me more confident in a person as a potential group member that I can consider in my own interviews. These kinds of answers included giving more detailed responses, providing examples of situations and drawing on other experiences and knowledge to show a deeper level of knowledge and experience.
