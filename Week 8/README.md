## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week our team project is in full swing and as a result our group have been holding regular stand up meetings and employng various project development practices. The full implementation of standup meetings has provided valuable insights into the benefits they provide to keep a project on track and team members accountable. By holding these meetings twice a week we have clear expectations on what everyone is working on, how the project is tracking and have clear times to have work competed by in order to share our progress at the meeting. This has showed me how even a small 5-10 minute meeting can be more effective than longer meetings discussing topics without neccessarily achieving all the meeting objectives. Additionally, we have had the opportunity to use different local development platforms, staging servers, Trello for project management and Github for team development. These reflect the standard of professional project management techniques utilised in industry and how they can increase productivity and accountability whilst minimising any disruption to team productivity.
