## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 4 hours completing various learning activities for CP3402 this week. 

## Content Insights
I learned the different uses of production; local/production and local/staging/production development processes for web development. When using a production only environment changes have an immediate affect on users as there is no local testing. A local/production environment is safer with changes made not having a direct impact on the published website but it lacks client preview functionality. Finally, a local/staging/production environment is a best practice arrangement that allows for developer testing, client feedback and controlled deployment. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Local/staging/production environments allow for greater separation of testing, client feedback and website deployment. This process improves collaboration in teams with version control to pull updates from staging to local or production environments. Additionally, this workflow allows for greater client involvement and communication by providing the capability for direct client feedback on the staging website before changes are implemented on the live site.

## Screenshots of Website Running on Local Host
The below screenshots showcase my WordPress website running on a local host. This was achieved through the use of XAMPP. Once XAMPP was downloaded Apache and MySQL were activated I downloaded a local version of WordPress and created a local database. Using these downloads wordpress was installed to allow the basic WordPress site to run. Then the content and styles of the existing Cloudaccess WordPress site were exported and imported into the locally hosted version.
