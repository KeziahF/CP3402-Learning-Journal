# CP3402-Learning-Journal-Week_2

## Learning Activities & Resources
I watched video tutorials about how to use Joomla and utilised blogs, FAQ pages and Joomla documentation to gain an understanding of how Joomla differs from other CMSs.

* CSS within HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp
* comparison of different CMSs: https://www.cloudways.com/blog/wordpress-vs-drupal-vs-joomla/
* Basic Joomla tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJhZTVZVWw0
* Basic Joomla information: https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Getting_Started_with_Joomla!

## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 5 hours of my own time on this subject. 

## Content Insights
I learned that the <stlye> element can be utilised within HTML to allow for the integration of CSS without a designated style sheet. I also learned that templates and articles form the foundation of a website in Joomla and that modifying the features and attributes of these features allow for more customisation of the pages. Additionally, editing the layout components allows for control of the HTML of the page and further customisation. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I found that watching the video tutorials allowed me to gain a basic understanding of the Joomla pages, however, I was less likely to watch the whole tutorial and needed to supplement these tutorials with more specific research to deepen my understanding and learn more about different scenarios than would be explored in these examples. This week was also my first time utilising a CMS so it allowed me to learn more about these systems and how they can be used for businesses.
