## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 4 hours completing various learning activities for CP3402 this week. 

## Content Insights
This week I learned about the process of stand-up meetings for project management. By hosting short minutes of up to 15 minutes in length these meetings can be used to keep all team members on track and ensure the project is progressing as required. These meetings involve asking three questions: 'What have you done this week?', 'What are you doing next?', 'Are there any roadblocks in your way?'. This meeting provides opportunities for all team members to raise concerns and establish clear plans for all stages of the project and are used by teams across the IT industry. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week I began working with my group to prepare our project management processes for the project. This involved developing our group work agreement, preparing our project management tools and our code repository. This practical process allowed for testing the project management techniques utilised in industry. When generating our group work agreement, I found that team members had different ideas of steps to take if someone was not completing their work. By having these conversations, we were able to decide on a clear plan to ensure everyone is adequately supported and all tasks are completed on time. These provide a clear understanding of the types of expectations for work within teams at an industry level and how to ensure that team performance is maintained for both overall team management and individual performance.
