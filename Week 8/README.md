### Hypothesis about a Learning Activity / Method
The hypothesis I aimed to test with my learning this week was that taking brief notes whilst watching the lecture recordings will improve my recall in comparison to passively watching the material. 

### Test for Hypothesis
In order to test this hypothesis, when I reviewed the content for this week I took notes of key topics to engage in active learning. In previous weeks I have reviewed the content more passively, watching the videos without taking notes. Due to the nature of the learning material a test could not be conducted on the same weeks content both with and without note taking. Therefore, in order to assess the impact of this learning technique qualitative results between week 7 and 8 were used to assess the validity of the hypothesis. 

### Results of Test
This test found that there was an increase in the recollection of details of the content when notes were taken. This showed that note taking enhanced my ability to both recall and apply material as opposed to passive learning. However, whilst these results proved the hypothesis, the true value of the revised learning process came from the ability to apply the material. This highlighted the effectiveness of active engagement with the content to increase recollection and application of key learnings. 

## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 3 hours completing various learning activities for CP3402 this week. 

## Content Insights
Customisation of the Underscores WordPress theme and organising content on a website provides valuable insights into the importance of both design flexibility and content structure. This learning highlighted the importance of effective content organisation and structure within a website in order to maximise the clarity of the content for users and visually engaging visitors. For example, grouping related content, reiterating key points and call to actions across the website. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week our team project is in full swing and as a result our group have been holding regular stand-up meetings and employing various project development practices. The full implementation of stand-up meetings has provided valuable insights into the benefits they provide to keep a project on track and team members accountable. By holding these meetings twice a week we have clear expectations on what everyone is working on, how the project is tracking and have clear times to have work competed by in order to share our progress at the meeting. This has showed me how even a small 5-10 minute meeting can be more effective than longer meetings discussing topics without necessarily achieving all the meeting objectives. Additionally, we have had the opportunity to use different local development platforms, staging servers, Trello for project management and GitHub for team development. These reflect the standard of professional project management techniques utilised in industry and how they can increase productivity and accountability whilst minimising any disruption to team productivity.
