# CP3402-Learning-Journal-Week_1

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I spent my time revising content from CP1406 and general html/css coding. I re-learned how to segment a webpage to create structure and break-up the content of the page. I also reviewed websites from a variety of start-up companies to begin deciding how I would approach my assignment. My main learning was also in testing different ways to publish my website and learning more about publishing to Github pages which I had not previously used.

## Estimated Hours
I spent about 6 hours revising html/css and working on a basic website design for the practical, not including time spent reviewing the subject content.

## Content Insights
This week the content focused mostly on revising content from CP1406 and preparing for the new learning structure. This allowed me to re-learn the basics of html and css whilst mostly focusing on figuring out the structure of the subject and what I need to do each week to be successful. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The opportunity to refresh my use of github and version control provided valuable career insights with these tools being crucial when working with a team or working on larger scale projects. Additionally, beginning to focus on an independent - research driven learning approach to the subject work poses a new opportunity to develop more career focused skills. However, in order to get the most out of the subject in future weeks I should allocate additional time each week to research more content relevant skills that I can try to implement into my assignments and/or practicals.
