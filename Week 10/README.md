## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 2 hours completing various learning activities for CP3402 this week. I focused mostly on the assignment work, with less focus on content to investigate.

## Content Insights
I learned the 5 P's of presentations - Planning, Preparation, Practice, Performance and Passion. These presentation skills were especially relevant as our team finalised the project and began preparing for the final presentation. Delivering a group presentation online, whilst also demonstrating multiple software components, presented some unique challenges. However, learning about and applying the 5 P's helped ensure our presentation was clear, engaging, well-organised and able to come together effectively. 

* Planning:
    * Planning involved defining the key points we wanted to discuss, grouping these into relevant sections and assigning team members to these sections. We created a rough outline early on that all team members used to detail what they would discuss and how best we could showcase our project features. 
* Preparation:
    * With demonstrating our workflows we prepared the supporting visuals and scenarios in advanced including recording some of the testing in advance to limit page shifting in the presentation.
* Practice:
    * We completed a number of practices as a team and these proved to be the biggest learning opportunity. In our initial run through we encountered issues with the amount of content we wanted to cover, unstable internet connections slowing down demonstrations and errors in the demonstration scenario. This showed the value of practice sessions, allowed the team to make changes to the presentation plan and conduct further practices to verify these changes.
* Performance:
    * For our presentations, we focused on delivering our content clearly and confidently, maintaining eye contact with the camera and ensuring links between each team members section. We also took multiple attempts to ensure there were no audio or video quality issues.
* Passion:
    * Passion was expressed through showing genuine enthusiasm for our project and was supported by discussing topics that we had a key role in. 

Overall, the learning and implementation of the 5 P's of presentations allowed our team to be prepared for the presentation and ensure that we could get the most out of the opportunity. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Content Management Systems (CMSs) play a vital role in modern industries by streamlining the creation, management, and distribution of digital content. As an IT professional working with CMSs, there are numerous career paths available—including CMS development, content writing, and consultancy. Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to explore several of these roles, including custom theme development, website design, and content management. While I am still unsure whether I will pursue a CMS-focused career, I intend to apply the skills I’ve gained to develop and deploy a website for my own business in the future. 

Over the 10 weeks of this subject, I also experimented with different learning strategies to focus on the application of the content. This included completing the weekly practicals, conducting additional research on the content, and maintaining a weekly learning journal—something I hadn’t done before. These learning activities encouraged me to deepen my understanding of topics beyond the standard coursework and allowed me to reflect on my progress regularly to understand how I am progressing throughout the subject.

Overall, I believe this is the most valuable IT subject I have completed in my degree so far. I have gained practical and soft skills that I am able to apply directly to industry projects and found real value in extending my learning through research and reflection.
