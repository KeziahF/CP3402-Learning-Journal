## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 2.5 hours completing the above learning activities for CP3402 this week. (I spent more time this week working on my assignment over general learning activities)

## Content Insights
I learned that child themes can be used to modify particular aspects of overall themes. These child themes can be created through the modification of css files for certain elements within the parent theme. I also learned that the php (functions) file of a WordPress site can be modified in order to incorporate additional style files into the theme in order to inherit these additional css elements. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The learning this week showed that the use of child themes allows for further customisation of a website. When considering future career opportunities, the ability to integrate css changes directly into a WordPress site allows for more flexibility that may be required when working with clients. Additionally, modifying the php and css files for templates and websites enables more advanced functionality to be implemented than standard templates allow for.
